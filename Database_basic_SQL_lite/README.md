**Oneâ€‘click launch (no installs):**

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/USERNAME/REPO/HEAD?labpath=IT1050_Module9_SQL_Lab.ipynb)

> Replace `USERNAME/REPO` after you upload this repo to GitHub.

## What this does
- Runs **SQLite** entirely in the notebook (no servers).
- Uses `ipython-sql` to execute SQL directly in cells.
- Creates tables, adds foreign keys (enforced logically), inserts data, runs queries, updates, and deletes.

## How to use
1. Click the Binder badge above after pushing this repo to GitHub and updating the link.
2. In JupyterLab, open **IT1050_Module9_SQL_Lab.ipynb**.
3. Run cells from top to bottom. Each task prints its output, ready for screenshots.
