# 💻 Fundamentals of Information Technology (Programming)

Welcome to the **Fundamentals of Information Technology** programming repository!
This repo contains a section of practical hands-on Python labs used in the course to help you understand how a computer system works through **Input → Storage → Processing → Output (ISPO)**.

---

## 🎯 Module Purpose

This module of the course introduces students to **core programming and computational thinking**.
By writing simple Python programs, you’ll learn how data flows through systems and how to design programs that make computers solve problems logically and efficiently.

You’ll gain experience with:

* Writing and running Python programs
* Understanding the **ISPO** model of computing
* Using loops, conditionals, and functions
* Handling errors and validating input
* Structuring clean and reusable code

## 🧮 In-Class Lab: Simple Calculator

The **Simple Calculator Lab** is your first coding exercise, introducing:

* Functions and variables
* Conditionals and loops
* Input/output
* Error handling
* Logical program flow (ISPO model)

### 🔗 Launch in Binder

Run the calculator live in your browser — no installation required!

## 🚀 Beyond the Calculator Projects

For students who want to go further — these optional mini-projects expand on your foundational skills.
Each one focuses on a specific new Python concept while reinforcing structured problem solving.
