# üöÄ Beyond the Calculator ‚Äì Optional Practice Projects

This folder contains **optional mini‚Äëprojects** for students who want to go beyond the in‚Äëclass Simple Calculator lab.  
Each script is self‚Äëcontained and follows the **Inputs ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Output** structure to reinforce systems thinking.

> üí° You can run these locally with `python <scriptname>.py`, or directly in Binder from the main repo using links below.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run (Locally)
```bash
cd Beyond_Calculator_Projects
python temperature_converter.py
```

## ‚úÖ Common Expectations
- Each program **clearly separates** Inputs, Storage, Processing, and Output.  
- Use **functions** for modularity.  
- Include **basic error handling** (e.g., `try/except` for user input).  
- Keep code **readable**: comments, meaningful names, and consistent formatting.
